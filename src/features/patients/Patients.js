        * in redux.  redux state is more about representing
        * the actual model being displayed by a given react
        * component.  A great example would be the frontend
        * for a RESTful-ish API with the usual sort of CRUD
        * operations.  in our case here, a /patients api.
        * the patients api serves up a list of distinct,
        * persistent resources, specifically patients, and
        * these are pulled into the UI by the thunk actions
        * (such as fetchPatients) that we dispatch to the redux
        * store.
        *
        * further, since this state mirrors the state of the
        * backend RESTful-ish resources, of which there is only
        * one authoritative state at any given time, it is not
        * only "ok" but actually desirable that the redux state
        * hold this "globally" (in the sense that there is only
        * one per application.
        *
        * filtering the list of patients is a good example of
        * what should rather go into the react state - and
        * by react state what we mean specifically is the component
        * state, by which we mean even more specifically the local
        * variables closured into the component returned by
        * our functional component function.
        *
        * if the user of this component wants to filter out
        * patients with a status of "inactive" (for example),
        * that does nothing to change the state of any
        * actual patient.
        *
        * further, there may be other components displaying
        * patients from our patients slice, and we would like them
        * to have their own view state independent of the state
        * of this one (and conversely).
        *
        * the way we access the "local state of the component" is
        * through the `useState` hook.  the state is stored in
        * closured local variables, but in order to trigger
        * re-render of the component when these change, we need
        * some kind of hook to let react know to check.
        * so, somewhat analogous to the way `useSelector` hook
        * triggers re-render on redux state changes, `useState`
        * triggers re-render on react state changes.
