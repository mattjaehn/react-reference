  /*
    * not all state needs to be stored in redux.  in fact,
    * as a rule, no more state than is necessary should be stored
    * in redux.  redux state is more about representing
    * the actual model being displayed by a given react
    * component.  A great example would be the frontend
    * for a RESTful-ish API with the usual sort of CRUD
    * operations.  in our case here, a /patients api.
    * the patients api serves up a list of distinct,
    * persistent resources, specifically patients, and
    * these are pulled into the UI by the thunk actions
    * (such as fetchPatients) that we dispatch to the redux
    * store.
    *
    * further, since this state mirrors the state of the
    * backend RESTful-ish resources, of which there is only
    * one authoritative state at any given time, it is not
    * only "ok" but actually desirable that the redux state
    * hold this "globally" (in the sense that there is only
    * one per application.
    *
    * filtering the list of patients is a good example of
    * what should rather go into the react state - and
    * by react state what we mean specifically is the component
    * state, by which we mean even more specifically the local
    * variables closured into the component returned by
    * our functional component function.
    *
    * if the user of this component wants to filter out
    * patients with a status of "inactive" (for example),
    * that does nothing to change the state of any
    * actual patient.
    *
    * further, there may be other components displaying
    * patients from our patients slice, and we would like them
    * to have their own view state independent of the state
    * of this one (and conversely).
    *
    * the way we access the "local state of the component" is
    * through the `useState` hook.  the state is stored in
    * closured local variables, but in order to trigger
    * re-render of the component when these change, we need
    * some kind of hook to let react know to check.
    * so, somewhat analogous to the way `useSelector` hook
    * triggers re-render on redux state changes, `useState`
    * triggers re-render on react state changes.

  /**
   * RULES for using React hooks:
   *
   * 1. NO CONDITIONAL EXECUTION: react tracks hooks by the order in which they are executed.
   * for this reason, it is very important that every hook execute each time a component
   * is rendered, and that the hooks are executed in the same order each render.  conditional
   * rendering could break that, since if a hook were conditionally NOT executed, then
   * that would mess up react s tracking for that hook, as well as every hook executed after it.
   *
   * 2. HOOKS MAY ONLY BE CALLED FROM THE TOP LEVEL OF A COMPONENT FUNCTION (never in for example,
   * an inner function), or from the top level of a custom hook.  (don t worry about custom hooks
   * now).
   *
   * 3. PREFIX ALL HOOK FUNCTION NAMES WITH `use`.  this is strictly a convention, but
   * it is one that facebook is very clear needs to be followed.  alot of the tools in
   * the react ecosystem assume this convention, apparently, and violating this simple
   * and reasonable convention brings risk of breaking only Marky Zuck knows what...
